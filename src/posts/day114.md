Such a pokemon-filled day. <br><br>

We were barely awake when we set out for another legendary raid. We met another pokemon trainer but the raid was no luck.<br><br>

We headed out the second time and Anna managed to snatch herself a Kuyrem.<br><br>

Max managed to solve multiple problems and located Nat's birthday gift displays together with an Irish call-center guy who couldn't speak French (Nat lives in France where the birthday gift was delivered).
