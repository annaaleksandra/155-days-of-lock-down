To everyone's surprise Max got up at 7am and went for a run?! <br><br>

He then showered and came back to bed...?<br><br>

What a weird day. <br><br>

We did another set of the skagens and ate cheesecake <3 <br><br>

Then went for a midnight ghost pokemon hunt but we only found bugs. Boo

Max makes hands down the best cheesecake
