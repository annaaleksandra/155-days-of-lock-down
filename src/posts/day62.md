Maxi had a bad stomach which makes sense because he cooked yesterday. <br><br>

We adventured to Tesco to see if they had gelatin. <br><br>

Meanwhile Anna tried to clean her hairbrush and followed Max's advice - she ended up burning it and stabbing herself due to the aftercare.

Note to Self: Don't follow Max's advice if it involves lighters (the black pins are burned)
