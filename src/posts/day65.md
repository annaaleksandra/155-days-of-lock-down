We went outside to play casino but Anna got angry because Max didn't deal properly. <br><br>

Max couldn't get past 5 points during the 3 games we played.<br><br>

We finished the greasiest lasagna ever and started watching Hobbit but Anna was way too tired.

Got to admit that Max makes REALLY good cheesecake!
