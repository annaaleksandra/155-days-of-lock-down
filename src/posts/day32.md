We both had a terrible night...<br><br>

We had watched the movie "The Girl on the Train" and somehow it resulted into weird dreams.<br><br>

We were too tired to buy groceries so we ordered the German DÃ¶ners which didn't do any favours to our stomachs.<br><br>

Anna watched 3 hours of "Don't Fuck with Cats" and we played Scrabble until 4am. Max had bullshit words like "vatu", "jo", "po" and "oi".
