Max woke up at 6:46 because the mattress wasn't good and woke Anna up as well. <br><br>

After ~1 hour Max stopped disturbing Anna and Anna went to sleep on the mattress. <br><br>

Maxi played all day. <br><br>

Anna went outside. <br><br>

Max almost crippled himself while descending from the sofa.

Yup, he's a special one.
