It's Annamaxiversary aka our Kissiversary :D (Our first anniversary) <br><br>

We went to Lidl to buy food for the day but the queue was so long that we turned back and went to Sainsbury's. <br><br>

We had nice steak & fries lunch and apero picknick on the sofa. <br><br>

We also watched the Hobbit which was fucking boring.
