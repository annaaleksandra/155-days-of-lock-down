Max didn't come to bed before 6am. We watched Iron Man 2 and The Incredible Hulk is on the list for tonight. <br><br>

Max clued his fingers together trying to fix Anna's cup. <br>
Anna got scared of the spider in the shower. <br><br>

We skipped cleaning.<br><br>

Max also used Anna's deodorant and braided our legs together. Okay?<br><br>

We finished B&J Cookie Dough.<br><br>
