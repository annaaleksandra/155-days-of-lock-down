We saw Shaun and Thais today for the last time in Edinburgh :( <br><br>

We had a nice and dirt-cheap lunch and then they went on their way. They are moving to Glasgow after tomorrow.<br><br>

I, however, have news from work! My manager suspects that we might open in 6 days. <br><br>

Max joined my fight against Python today but after 4 hours I am at loss.<br><br>

I had a nap today.
