Anna started craving pizza so that's what we got. <br><br>

We also went to the post office, but the queue was like 10 people waiting outside.<br><br>

Luckily there was a kiosk that sold stamps so Max's mom might receive her card at some point.<br><br>

We also made a home-made exfoliating scrub (coconut oil and brown sugar) and Maxi managed to get it everywhere.
