Today our gourmet chef cooked us some fake carbonara and Anna's grandma didn't know what it was.<br><br>

We fought about guinea pigs but take away ramen seemed to settle it.<br><br>

Max also called himself "Taxi", an abbreviation of "tired Maxi" a couple od nights ago and I want to remember it forever.
