Max played so well at Rocket League (at least that's what he said) THAT he came to bed at 5am.<br><br>

And Anna had to turn to Harry to continue sleeping (Harry Potter audiobooks).<br><br>

Max has fought through valiantly most of the very strong cheese we bought yesterday.<br><br>

We played cards outside for a moment and Max managed to attract some weirdo and have a good chat.<br><br>

We later caught a Kuyrem each from a succesful raid.
