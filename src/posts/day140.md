We had a quick walk and there was a dead bird on the ground. Max said sarcastically "Thanks for warning me!" while he was 1 meter from the bird and he'd have to go through me to actually step on the bird.<br><br>

I thought he was being extra. <br><br>

We also were very confused about London Castle and Birmingham Palace.
