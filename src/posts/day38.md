Sleep is for pussies and Anna! So I will probably fall asleep in the next 4 hours. <br><br>

You can see the state of Max's mind by the way he writes "pussies" (handwriting was quite messy).<br><br>

We went for a long walk, explored the neighbourhood and Max had a 6-hour nap. My fault, of course.<br><br>

Anna's mindframe: "I will wake you up when stifado (a meal) is ready" Oops she forgot but it's my fault + stifado was left out, obviously Max's fault?
