Max cooked expired bacon for breakfast and we went to Lidl. <br><br>

We moved a lot of furniture around and made stupid decisions like not having anywhere to put things on in the bedroom and turning our wardrobe into chest. But it all turned up quite well.<br><br>

Max broke our bench by putting his knee through it.
