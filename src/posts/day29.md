Due to Max's problem solving skills we now have a huge printer standing in the hallway (explanation: Max had some problems with getting his UK passport and his father grew tired of helping him and decided to send us a printer). <br><br>

He also made an easter egg with melted chocolate, cling film and a clementine.
