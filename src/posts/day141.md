We walked to the city to go to Waterstones so I could buy something that stimulates my brain. <br><br>

Instead, I watched Max play Animal Crossing which numbed my brain so badly that I couldn't get off of the sofa. <br><br>

We've beem smelling a weird sewage smell all day.<br><br>

Max is cute <3

The ultimate mind-numbing game to watch.
