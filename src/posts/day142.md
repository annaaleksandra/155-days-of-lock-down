Bad news. Internet is still down because some one crashed their car to the electric box outside.<br><br>

We did go outside to play some cards when Anna decided to test her heavy legs and jump on a concrete bench.<br><br>

She didn't make it and neither did the skin on leg.<br><br>

Max spent the rest of the evening disinfecting the wound and plastering me.<br><br>

And we are exercising tomorrow ar 2pm!

(Disclaimer: The wound on the leg kept bleeding for three days, we should've probably get some stiches. I decided not to add a picture to this post about the wound.)
