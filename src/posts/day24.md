Such a fucking rollercoaster this day was. <br><br>

Egghunt in the morning, cutting hair in the afternoon. <br><br>

It didn't end well, Max probably wants to forget about it. <br><br>

Then we cooked weird beef rice.

A note I left for Max to let him know about the Egghunt!

Max's hair was __everywhere__ after a quick fix...
