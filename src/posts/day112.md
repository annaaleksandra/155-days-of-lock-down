Such a normal quaranteen day. <br><br>

We have a spider in the ceiling in the bedroom.<br><br>

We watched some Derry Girls.<br><br>

Our cream potatoes were never ready so we had to eat steaks first and potatoes later.<br><br>

We also caught a Charizard and Max caught a Kuyrem.<br><br>

Anna has tried to write a ciphering algorithm all day.

On our way to catch some Pokemons. Max didn't enjoy the bright day.
