We have not gone to work. So WE CLEAN. State of mind: We're already such weirdos that after the quarantine we'll probably get locked up.<br>

Living room was shiny so we decided to clean other rooms following days. <br><br>

Max drank coffee. <br>
Anna broke her cup.  <br><br>

We ate good chicken for the first time in our life and bad courgette and onion. <br>
Max went to buy bin bags.
