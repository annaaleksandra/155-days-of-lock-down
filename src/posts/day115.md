We had mini pizza naan breads after some exhaustive Lidling. <br><br>

This was not a good pokemon day, we didn't manage to beat Tentacruel in a 3-star raid.<br><br>

Anna also evolved Eevee again to a wrong pokemon after having walked 10km with it.<br><br>

Max was happy about a "genuine fart" caused by a tower of stress (used teabags stacked on one another).
