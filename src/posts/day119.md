Today I woke up choking on my stomach acid. Anna was ligthning quick and would have saved me. She had water in one hand and inhaler in the other. <br><br>

We met up with up with our pokemon go posse and caught a Kuyrem each. To hurry me up Anna kicked over my tea and then blamed on me. She pleaded her case to the other girls of the group who all agreed with her.<br><br>

In my defence Max already spilled the tea and left it at the exact same spot on the floor. <br><br>

I was unlucky enough to step in it.
