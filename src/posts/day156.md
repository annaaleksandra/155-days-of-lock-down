Work day! <br><br>

We wore masks and face covers and I washed dishes 2 hours straight.<br><br>

Standing for four hours was super weird and I was a bit knackered when I got home.<br><br>

But it was good to get out and talk to people. <br><br>

If everything goes well and this pandemic is finally going to easen, we might eventually be able to travel to see our families.<br><br>

Our lockdown took 155 days, ending on the 20th of August 2020.

My work attire. I would have never believed before this pandemic that one day I'd wear a mask and a visor for work.
