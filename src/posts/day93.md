We have a 7-day streak on Pokemon GO. <br><br>

We were so tired of catching all the pokemons in the afternoon that we took a nap and Max woke up as a completely different person. <br><br>

It's like I'm having a broken jukebox that sometimes dances...<br><br>

It's beautiful, the true love.<br><br>

PS. I'm addicted to catching Pokemon and Max's songs!!!!!<3 -Anna hmm hmm (This was still written by Max)
