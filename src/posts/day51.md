Max always leaves Anna the broken bowl :( <br><br>

Max slept very long today and Anna went outside only to find out it's raining. <br><br>

Also Anna's workplace is prolonging the furlough till the end of June, meaning 40+ quaranteen days. <br><br>

*Written by Max:*
Max destroyed a suitcase like a winner.

Max doing his thing (and being __BALD__)... There was some reasoning to this but it's hard to remember afterwards...
