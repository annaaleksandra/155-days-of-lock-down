Max was sleepy this morning but Anna shook him from the bed to catch a pokemon. Brzonk or something similar.<br><br>

We also caught a Marill and a Cubone on our way back.<br><br>

Then we finished a quizz for Max's family for tomorrow.<br><br>

We are also meeting Felipe and Larissa tomorrow at the Stockbridge Contacless Market.

Max's jogging bottoms arrived. It was a little too late to find out that the "stripes" actually type "Fuck You".
