Today was a new event on Pokemon go and the end of the bug special.<br><br>

We both quizzed and placed terribly. <br><br>

I managed to spill my morning tea but then I found the pen I wrote the first lines of today's log with before it died. <br><br>

Winning! <br><br>

Anna is furiously scrubbing something in the sink with a certain degree of violence.<br><br>

Maybe she is still mad about destroying the plant during her quizz.
